# dotfiles
Dotfiles for all of my tools 

## Nvim 
- Include some configs that based on NVChad

### How to use
1. Clone the repo, replace the nvim to config dir
    etc: the config dir is: `~/.config/nvim`
    => Run these commands: 
  - Remove old configs (or u can rename to create a backup): `rm -rf ~/.config/nvim`
  - Copy this config to dest: 
    ```
        cd dotfiles;
        cp -r ./nvim ~/.config/
    ```
